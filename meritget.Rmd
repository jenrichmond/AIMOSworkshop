To optimise a walkthrough, we propose it must have both extrinsic and intrinsic incentives. In a research context, the extrinsic incentive is a given. We propose building a walkthrough with the objective of *meritget*. 

![In the 2009 Nintendo hand=held DS game Scribblenauts, the player is informed of "merit get", when a trophy, "merit", is earned. (image source [wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Scribblenauts_cover.jpg?1572521817931))](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3a/Scribblenauts_cover.jpg?1572521817931)


We informally define *meritget* to be the moment when you turn to the person beside you and high-five at an unconference such as AIMOS. A working formal definition of meritget is an intrinsic incentive that does not have extrinsic value but sparks joy in the user.  

A possible line of discussion for the hackathon is a formal definition of *meritget* and specifically how we tried to achieve *meritget*  in our *walkthrough for data analysis*.
