# what will need doing

We welcome an interest in contributing to at least one of the following, or proposing another working category: 

- Visual design of the cheatsheet. Curiously, the cheatsheet templates in rstudio are in ppt or keynote. Do we develop the cheatsheet with design of expediency in mind? Do we create a walkthrough that works in a `posterdown::` template as the first draft? So, we design as one workflow.;  
- Pedagogical values and objectives; 
- Technical implementation in .Rmd;
- Write-up of [manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10cPvhgJT93lsRmel9A43qgdt30hxX6Xkq4e92MHqFT8/edit?usp=sharing) that describes and publishes the cheatsheet.

## visual design

# skills required for participation

Advanced knowledge of R is not required; merely an interest in the kind of problems you would like to use R to solve. Attendees of the associated workshop, Letâ€™s start at the very beginning, are warmly invited to bring insights from their recent introduction to R, as there will be obstacles and smooth points in the learning process that are not as immediately apparent to those who have been using R for several years.
