# Packages

A package is a group functions that some kind person has written, tested, bundled together and given away for everyone to use. 

<br>

.pull-left[

To install packages, type into your console. Just do this once. 

<br>

To use a package, load it using the `library()` function. You need to do this every time you want to use the functions in a package.

# What is the tidyverse?  

.pull-left[

The tidyverse is a mega-package (i.e. a package of other packages) designed to make data wrangling and visualisation easier.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

is the same as...

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

```



] 

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy_workflow.png")

``` 

] 

It's a good idea to put `library(tidyverse)` at the top of every analysis document. You will probably need it.

# Your turn 2: install some packages

Step 1. In your console, install...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("packagename")
```

Step 2. Then open the demo.Rmd file and add the following to the "code chunk" under `library(tidyverse)`. 

```
library(janitor) 
library(here)
library(beepr)
library(skimr)

```
Run the code in the chunk using the little green arrow on the right 

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 4, seconds = 00)

# An aside about RMarkdown

.pull-left[

RMarkdown documents (or .Rmd files) are key to reproducible analysis. 
- notes/explanations + "chunks" of R code 
- "knit" the document (notes + code + output) into a nice format that other people (who may not know R) can access. 

### Tricks and tips

- Insert a chunk using shortcut Alt-Cmd-I
- Hash to get levels of heading
- Asterisks to get bold and italics

# Your turn 3: "Knit" your RMarkdown document

.pull-left[

Change a few things about the text in the demo.Rmd doc

- Change the title at the top
- Add a few headings using #
- Make words bold by putting them in double asterik

Then choose "Knit" and check out the output.

# Getting data in

---

# Where is the data?

.pull-left[

The `here` package will help avoid file path drama. You can use it to tell R where you data is, relative to the top level of your project folder. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/here.png")
```
 
] 

.pull-right[

We can use the `read_csv()` from `readr` and `here()` to read a .csv file. 

#### Template code

```
df <- read_csv(here("data", "file.csv"))

```
<br>

> BTW you can read .xls, .sav, .sas, .stata, but you will need to install the `readxl` or `haven` packages.
