Timestamp,Raindrops on roses,Whiskers on kittens,Bright copper kettles,Warm woollen mittens,Brown paper packages tied up with string,Cream-colored ponies,Crisp apple strudels,Doorbells,Sleighbells,Schnitzel with noodles,Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings,Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes,Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes,Silver-white winters that melt into springs,How many times do you think you have you seen The Sound of Music?
